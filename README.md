Cinema Booking System
A simple cinema ticket booking system developed in Java using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Swing. The system allows users to create accounts, log in, browse available movies and showtimes, book tickets, view booked tickets, and cancel reservations.

 System Components
Graphical User Interface (GUI): Includes screens for login, sign-up, movie list browsing, and ticket booking/cancellation.

User Management: Users can register new accounts and log in with a username and password.

Movie Management: Displays a list of available movies and their corresponding showtimes.

Ticket Management: Allows users to book tickets, view their bookings, and cancel tickets.

Data Persistence: User, movie, and ticket data are saved using Java object serialization (.ser files).
